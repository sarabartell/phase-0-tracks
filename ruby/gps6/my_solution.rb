# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#require -- paths the files
#require_relative -- gives a mapped out path when the computer may not know where the file is
require_relative 'state_data'

# DRIVER CODE
 # initialize VirusPredictor for each state

#want to loop through every single state in STATE_DATA, to print out the methods
#need: state name, pop. density, and popultaion
#will have to call virus effects as well on each state
STATE_DATA.each do |state_name, state_info|
  state = VirusPredictor.new(state_name, state_info[:population_density], state_info[:population])
  state.virus_effects
end

# alabama = VirusPredictor.new("Alabama", STATE_DATA["Alabama"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["Alabama"][:population])
# alabama.virus_effects

# jersey = VirusPredictor.new("New Jersey", STATE_DATA["New Jersey"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["New Jersey"][:population])
# jersey.virus_effects

# california = VirusPredictor.new("California", STATE_DATA["California"][:population_density], STATE_DATA["California"][:population])

# Reflection Section

#there is a hash rocket and a symbol style shown in this hash, they are similar but are called differently with their names when irrirated on
#require relative gives a specific map or path to a folder that your code needs to pull from. require kinds of assumes that path was already made like being put in the same directory
# .each, .each_key, you can use while and iuntil looks inside of the each loops
# that the method was calling on instance variables and calling on two methods that called on instance variables that didnt need to be called since the variables were already readable.
#refactoring even the smallest steps like an equation in every if/else line
