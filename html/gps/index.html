  <p>There are several HTML5 purposes. It is a way to make the code more detailed and blocked out when organizing a page and a way to standardize between developers, it can also make it easier to read by other software's such as a search engines or help with impairment such as a blind user.
I see main and sections as very useful because it helps break up the information, I think sections are useful because you can group content that is related together in its own block.

    we learned we could create snippets of code to save for later. I could see this being useful in CSS when you need certain styles for elements over again.

    It was hard to understand what a snippet was at first because I wasn't sure what I was looking at. I can try making some and reading up to understand them.
