# Git Definitions

Instructions:  Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 - version control is a way to manage your files through commands and tasks. It is useful because it helps keep information organized, you can store different versions and share them with others, you can back up your versions and keep them in secure areas.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
 - a branch is similar to a copy of a file or project, but with a name that is different and progresses in parallel to "master" to keep the information separate while changes are made. You would use one if you are adding information or editing information that may be experimental or semi-permanent and don't want to mess up the information on "master"
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 - a commit is when you make a change on a branch, master or another, and you submit it to that branch as a permanent piece of the code. It's kinda of like submitting final edits to a book that will become part of the manuscript.
 A good commit message is active tense, and describes to others what changes or updates were made in the commit, i.e. "add about me paragraph"
* What is a merge conflict?
a merge conflict occurs when multiple changes have been made to a specific line of code, and the versions between branches and master are different, and conflict at that exact point. They can be resolved by comparing the conflict and keeping the piece of code that is going to be permanent
