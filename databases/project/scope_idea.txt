create ruby program that uses persistent data!

miles ran tracker to let runners store their run, retrieve their past runs, and delete accidental entries

step 1: set up datebase with sqlite3, call runs.db
create table that contains primary key, run length (in miles), run time, run date

want to execute this creation of the table one time

write a method that takes the runs.db, length, time, date as arguments

write a UI that allows the user to add data
write a UI that allows user to recall the data (show the full table)
write a UI that allows user to delete data
write a UI that allows user to update data

maybe if feeling fancy add another table that also captures the runs by month
so that user can view with a relational table how many runs they do per month?
